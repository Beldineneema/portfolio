        “Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I wondered <br>
        why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the opposite of that<br>
        in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of girls back in Tzaneen<br>
        being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always explained it, the traditional<br>
        man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls in love with subservient women. He’s<br>
        attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic bird collector,” she said. “He only wants <br>
        a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.”<br>
        <p>
        </em>
</h3>
            In the last chapter of the book Born A Crime; my mother's life portrais more on Abel's<br>
            characters. His habbit of drankardness icreases to the next level and he starts to mishalled<br>
            He portays male chauvinism in that chapter. He shows how men in the traditon rule over their <br>
            houses because they think they are superior just as their tradion dictacts. Abel start to<br>
            beat Patricah because he wants her to be submissive to whatever he says which is very ironical<br>
            to Patricahwho is an independent mordern woman and doesnot have beliefs in Africa tradions<br> 
            that has no value to her. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Abel feels emasculated by her refusal to be an obedient and traditional wife, especially <br>
            after she embarrasses him in front of his extended family. She tries to support his <br>
            talents and ambitions, but he does not want to see his wife recognized for being<br>
            intelligent and competent<br>
            Despite obviously being frustrated with Abel and aware of his flaws, Patricia<br>
             resists leaving him for a long time. The reasons for this are complex. <br>
             South African society tends to shrug off domestic violence or even condone <br>
             a man's right to "discipline" his wife.

            In this second second part we’ll evaluate the whole book and discuss various instances<br>
            that display humour and its impacts focusing on how it helped Trevor Noah make friends and<br>
            helped him out of difficult situations. Well, I will start by explaining the meaning of <br>
            humour: Humour is the ability to findthingsfunny, the way in which people see that some <br>
            things are funny, or the quality of being funny. The following points explains humour much <br>
            more based on Trevor Noah’s Born A Crime.

    </h2>
    <p>
        When Trevor was at Maryvale school chapter 6, the school always had  Friday mass. The mass <br>
        had some rules that Trevor never understood  made no sense to him. Things like;  standing,<br>
        sitting and kneeling on and off and thereafter students who were Catholics could eat the blood<br>
        and body of Jesus which was grape juice and crackers but Trevor could not eat because he was <br>
        not a Catholic. This act of eating Jesus’ blood and body of Jesus really disturbed Noah,<br>
        nevertheless he never got any answer to it. Because he knew Jesus was for everyone and not for<br>
        The Catholics alone.
        So one morning before the mass had started he decided to go against the Catholic rules<br>
        .”I’m going to get me some Jesus’ blood  and body.” said Trevor to himself. This act was <br>
        funny but risky all the same because it could have caused trouble from both the school and<br>
        his mum  but funnily enough, unexpected happened that his mum sided with him and took him from<br>
        that school which was what he wanted, to get out of that school.<br>
                                                                                         <br>

                                                                                            <br>
        Trevor also narrates to us in his book Born A Crime of how he once got arrested  by cops<br>
        with the accusation of driving a stolen car with a wrong plate. He says that when he arrested <br>
        the cops got hold of him in the holding cell for some couple of days. Life in a holding cell <br>
        is usually very harsh because prisoners  bully themselves and it depends on how powerful you<br>
        are in terms of the crime you got arrested of. So he says he had to find new ways and tricks<br>
        to help him maneuver while inside there. Trevor decides to fake his identity as one of the most<br>
        dangerous coloured criminals in South Africa since people already had the mentality that colored<br>
        criminals are normally the worst ones. So that also created room for him to have such humorous <br>
        practice to help him out of trouble since none of the fellow prisoners could dare harass him <br>
        while inside the cell.
        <br>

        <br>

Another humorous instance in Trevor's book happens when he was at this new primary school<br>
 and it happened that he was always late for school and therefore could never miss in the<br>
  latecomers list. Whenever the list for latecomers could be read, Trevor was always  the first<br>
   one to stand up because he can never miss there. “There was this one time I stood up and then<br>
    the prefect called out the names of five people who were late that day and my name wasn't<br>
     among them. Everyone burst out laughing because my name was expected but instead it was not<br>
      there.”  Says Noah in chapter 11. This made him to be a girl's guy because of his funny deeds<br>
       since girls in his school loved to hang around him because he could make them laugh.
